Multithreading:

As we load public static void main, we have one thread in action i.e. the main thread. 

Thread class is in lang package. 
Use of thread class: Thread is unit of execute. When we write public static void main, that thread
executes in our program. That function is a unit of execute. 
Now we would have more threads executing simultaneously. How ?
We create object of thread class and we have another thread in parallel. 
Creating object does not mean thread is started. 
Thread is a unit of execution, so whenever it executes, it wants to know what it has come for?
Main thread knows what it has come for. 
Every thread should have a reply for what its lifetime is. 
When we say thread.start, the thread comes into queue. 
Suppose another thread comes into queue. They would be execute whenever jvm has time.
