Hibernate:
It is ORL. Object Relation Mapping.
Object means object of class. Relation means row in table. So we map and object to row in a table. 

Eg: Student table has certain columns. We will create student class. 
Every object of student class will contain data of one student. Row of student table also contains data about one student. 
Objects of classes in Hibernate are saved as rows in database. 

In Eclipse go to Java environment. 
File > New > Java project > HIBTry > Next > Libraries > Add Library... > 
Hibernate is framework. To use hibernate we need to have lot of jar files included. Two ways to add library.
1. Add individual library.
2. Create user defined library which contains all jar files of hibernate. I did using:
When I click Add Library..., Add Library box will open. Choose User Library > Next > User Libraries... > New... > name:hibernate > OK
Add external jars > go to C:\Program Files\Hibernate\hibernate-release-5.2.2.Final (downloaded hibernate framework for this)

Downloading hibernate: Go to http://hibernate.org/orm/downloads/ and download 5.2.2 Final. Save it in downloads.
Unzip from downloads and extract to C:\Program Files\Hibernate\

Now go to C:\Program Files\Hibernate\hibernate-release-5.2.2.Final\lib\required
Watch video at 10th mins to 14 mins. Adding all required jars. Then finished as per video.

Hibernate consists of xml called configurations xml. We are studying hibernate 4 which has reduced number of xmls. Old hibernate had many many xmls.

Connect to database:
Go to Package Explorer > HIBTry > Right click > Build Path > Configure Build Path > Java build path window will open >
Choose Libraries tab > Add external jars > Go to C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\jdbc\lib > Choose ojdbc_6g > Apply > OK

Create a xml:
Go to Package Exploere > HIBTry > src > Right click > New > Other > Window appears, type xml, choose xml file > Next
File name: hibernate.cfg.xml (we can give any name, but this is default name)> Next >  Next > Finish
Benefit of default name: Hibernate uses default name. If we give other name and then we have to specify other name everywhere. 

Create a database in Data Source Explorer named java4 identified by j2ee
