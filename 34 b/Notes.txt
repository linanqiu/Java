Created new Tomcat server in Eclipse. Location is C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0

On August 20:
Installed Glassfish at C:\User sj2659\Glassfish
Because old Glassfish is installed inside Program Files which can only be modified by admin C:\Program Files\glassfish4.1.1
Created new Glassfish server in Eclipse. Username and password are default. Username: admin. Password - nothing specific leave it blank

Important: Tomcat is located in Program Files while GlassFish is located in User sj2659 for new Eclipse Neon :)
