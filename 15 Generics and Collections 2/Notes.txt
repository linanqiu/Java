Set: Set is inherited by two classes: HashSet and TreeSet

Tree Set - Tree means binary search tree. When we retrieve elements from binary search tree we get them in ascending order. 
Effectively in case of a tree set, whenever we get them out, we get in ascending order. Means we don't retrieve elements in same order as we kept.

When we are creating any datastructure object, any collection object. The generic datatype can be replaced by any class. 
It should not be integer, string or double, it can be any class.  

HashSet

Vector: It is same as ArrayList. Except that vector is by default synchronized. 
ArrayList is dynamic array

DataStructures we know:
ArrayList
LinkedList
HashSet
TreeSet
Comparable
Comparator
Vector
Stack

Map: Key-Value pair
On left hand size is key
On right hand size is called value
We cannot store single elements like ArrayList or Vector. But we put double elements.
