What is JDK, JRE:

JVM has subset called JIT Compiler. Image from http://viralpatel.net/blogs/java-virtual-machine-an-inside-story/
Class files are platform independent. So we get portability to other platform provided that platform supports jre.

Just in time compilation: Only part of code under if or else loop gets executed, not after that. Eg:
A code says if x is true then exit, JIT will exit it. It will never execute the remaining part of code. 
This saves time :)
Architecture independence - 32 bit and 64 bit are different architecture. 
Active class - Class that contains main function is called active class. 


To run java in command line, add C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_91\bin to your environment variable PATH.

Go to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_91\jre\lib and open rt.jar. It is most important library of Java. 
All jar files are libraries of java. Inside jre\lib most of them are installed by default so we need not import them.

Java supports two types of data:
1. Value type: Data has a value.
2. Reference type: Addresses.

Typecasting: Converting one type to another.
