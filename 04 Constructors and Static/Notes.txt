Static: If a method is defined static, we do not need to use individual objects.
We can directly call classname.methodname.
Eg: System.out.println. out method of String class is static. 
Math.sin(), Math.exp(), Math.power(), Math.add(). These are already created. They are utility functions.
They are static. 


Constructor: 
Function of a class that has same name as class. They are called whenever object is created. It is used to initialize values.

Static members should not be initialized with constructor cuz constructor is related to object creating. S
Static members do not depend on object being created. They are there by default. To initialize static members we
have static block.

Static block: Static block is a block of lines of code in a class which gets automatically called whenever this class is
loaded into memory. 
Static function or a static block can only call other static members. 
Static block gets called only once, there is no way to call it second time. 
Once we create a variable inside a static block, it is created and could not be changed outside the block. 

Singleton design pattern: A class for which we cannot create more than one object. 

Inner class: Class inside a class
Outer class cannot use resources of Inner class. 


Inheritance: In java a child can have only one parent. A parent can have multiple child but
a child can have only one parent. We do inheritance for extending the features, for specification,
