Commit: why is it important in database
Changes made in Java program are automatically committed. In commandline window autocommit has values set to False. 
Changes happen to database but they are temporary. But in other environment like Oracle10G is installed
we get link to run it from browser and do some changes, then we do not need to commit
So it depends on the environment we are interacting with database.

JSP - Java Server Pages

Why learn? 
It is easy to write
Java is strongly typed language, no error or permitted. Servlet is Java so it is difficult
But on other hand HTML is easy, uppercase and lowercase does not matter. Program still runs with some extra/less tags

JSP is complete HTML except portion inside <% %> is java
How does JSP run?
Server is not able to run JSP
We write JSP and it is stored in server
When client first calls JSP, the server converts JSP into servlet 
That servlet is the one which responds to every client
So it is the servlet which is responding to every client and not the JSP

Even if we put a dot in JSP and save that
what server does is: whenever it gets a call for JSP, it looks into the JSP code that it has. 
Looks for date last modified
If date and time last modified is same as or earlier than my server was created, then it will give call to servlet and get response. 
JSP got modified after servlet was generated. 
Client always gets the most updated response from jsp. 
JSP writing and updating is easy. 
Disadvantage: First client call takes some extra time. JSP takes conversion time, that conversion time becomes overhead for the first call.
Later all calls are entertained by servlet. 
This is a JSP.

Everytime we make change to JSP, the previous servlet is discarded and new one is started. 
In that case also it will take sometime. The first request would always be delayed.

In JSP we use following:

1. Directive tag
<% @  %>
There are 3 directive tags: page, include, taglib

A. page tag is used to specify the inputs
<% @page import="java.util.Date"%> 

B. include tag
<% @include....>


2. Declarations tag
<%! 
Connection con
PreparedStatement ps1;
public void jspInit(){    //JspInit becomes Init function of our servlet. We can do variable declaration here.
	write init code here
} 
> 

3. Scriptlet tag: We write complete java inside this. Whatever we have learned so far we can write it here
<% 
out.println("Sanket");
... scriptlet tag ...
%>


4. Output Tag 
<% = "adfasdf"> //Whatever we write here is printed. It is short form of out.println
