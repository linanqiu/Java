We want to create a webservice and host that, we need an application server. 
Webservice is host service for programmers. So that programmers can connect to that the service, all functions of service and get results from service. 
Major companies have webservice. One webservice, different platforms: iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, Mac

Webserver: can only hold servlets and jsp and let my client call them.
Application server: also supports EAR files. Enterprise Application is EAR.
