Synchronization:
If there is shared resource. As long as first thread is using resource, the next one must
not be allowed to use. Doing this is called synchronization.

Deadlock:
Eg: three threads, all are busy. Thread1 says he is busy and needs Thread2.
Thread2 says he is busy and he needs Thread3.
Thread3 says he is busy and he needs Thread1.
Deadlocks occur in case of circular referencing. 
To avoid deadlocks we have few functions. 
But always try to avoid circular referencing.
Deadlocks are possible only in case of synchronization
