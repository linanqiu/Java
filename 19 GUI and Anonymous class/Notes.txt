Also introduced important concept of anonymous class.

Started Swing
At about 30-35 min of video

go to java730 > right click > new > other > type jfr (will showup jframe) > choose it
click next > Package name (org.javaiw.swing) > Name (MyJFrame) > Finish


AWT contains almost all controls required to create a GUI. AWT uses components from os system. AWT does not have its own components. 
If we say insert a button, AWT gets button from our os. If we are working on windows 8, we get button according to windows 8. 
So look and feel would not be uniform throughtout in all executions, it will depend on platform

What is swing?
But swing components are java created.
Inside Paletter in MyJFrame most of names start with J like JPanel in containers.
Everything is with J, it means each of these components is defined and designed by Java
We can customize look and view 




Commands to build MyFrame.java:
------------------------------

go to java730 > right click > new > other > type jfr (will showup jframe) > choose it
click next > Package name (org.javaiw.swing) > Name (MyJFrame) > Finish

Right click > Set Layout > BorderLayout
In Palette > JTabbedPane click it > drop it in center

In Palette > Containers > JPanel click it > put in tabbedPane
put another panel, do it total of 4 times

In Structure > go to panel click it > go to Palette > Components > JButton > drop it on tab > Write on it "OK"
In Structure > go to panel_1 click it > go to Palette > Components > JTextField > drop it on tab
In Structure > go to panel_2 click it > go to Palette > Components > JCombobox > drop it on tab 
	To add items to combobox:
	Go to Properties > click on model > Inside ComboBox model items, type India, China and other countries > Click OK
In Structure > go to panel_3 click it > go to Palette > Components > JRadioButton > drop it on tab > Type "Male Candidate

Go to first tab > click it > Go to Properties > Association > Title > change title to "Tab 1"
do same for all 4 tabs 

Now we want that when we click OK on Tab1, we should move to Tab2

Double click "OK" button. It will take us to ActionPerformed event of Source-MyFramce.java  
type: tabbedPane.setSelectedIndex(1);
