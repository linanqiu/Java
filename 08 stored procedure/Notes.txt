Stored Procedures:
We can write procedure on our data server. A procedure is like a function.
That function can contain logic. It can be run by calling that procedure/function.
We will create procedure in oracle.
Then connect your java program to oracle service. Run that procedure. 
My java program will not run sql query, rather it would run a procedural line on dataserver. 

---------------
Create a procedure:
Run sql command line
