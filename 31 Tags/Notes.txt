---------------

We will create tags today
Go to Web1 > New > Class > package:org.javaiw.model, Name: HelloTag, SuperClass: SimpleTagSupport >Finish

We need to write tld to create our own tag
Go to Web1 > Other > type xml, take simple xml > Next > put in Web1>WEB-INF, name it: HelloTag.tld > Next > Finish

Why to use tag ?
We want to minimize java code. So we put logic in tag and do remaining with jsp.
Logic should be done in doTag method. 


HW:

Have a table named accounts
which has columns like - account no, customer name and balance

<bank:deposit accountno="234532144" amount="1534"/>   this tag should work. This tag will
send call to your doTag function. doTag function will run a query which increases the amount in this
particular account by this amount. 

<bank:withdraw accountno="1462576134" amount="365632"/>   this tag should withdraw this amount
<bank:newacc cname="Sanket" amount="26243"/>   should create a new account
<bank:close accountno="25625"/>   should run a delete query and delete my account
<bank:show accoutno="2562343"/>  all details of this account would be displayed on the screen. Name, balance.
