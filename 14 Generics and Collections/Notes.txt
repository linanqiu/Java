Supporting files are: 
org.javaiw.generics - IStack.java, TStack.java, TStack1.java
org.javaiw.collections (These all are generics)- ArrayListDemo.java, 
Student.java + ArrayList1.java, LinkedListDemo.java

1. Generics

2. Collections: 
Collections heirarchy is in package java.util
At top of heirarchy we have interface called collection
Collection is an interface and it is inherited by some other interfaces.

After IStack, TStack, TStack1:

First interface we work is list

Few characteristics of list: 
1. Indefinite size, dynamic. 
2. Index. 
3. Order of element is preserved. 
4. List allows duplicacy. 
5. Allows to add null elements.

Where do we use collections ? Google it. Interesting read.
