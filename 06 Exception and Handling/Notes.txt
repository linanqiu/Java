
Throwable class is inherited by Error and Exception class. 
Error: Problems which cannot be handled auotmatically. Eg: Hardware failure.
Exception: Can be handled. JVM throws the exception. JVM responds to erratic code by throwing the exception.

A few types of Exception:

3. Null Pointer Exception: Trying to use a variable which does not have any object. Eg: Box b1; b1.l=10;. Exception because we have not written: Box b1 = new Box();
4. Illegal Access Exception: Try to access a private object of class outside the class.
